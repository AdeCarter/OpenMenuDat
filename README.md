Dat files for Open Menu artwork etc

Nothing massively exciting, check GameIDs.csv for all the titles covered. Artwork has a bias towards PAL, because thats my region.

For homebrew/mods/etc you'll need to change your GameID in OpenMenu to match the ones in the CSV

Extract files from https://1drv.ms/u/c/aa50ee0908cf365a/IQC-kH1GnLHjQoMI0Ktp4vBXAfGyDdKEvqWRwrg9J6GAzyo?e=qXgWhS to \tools\openMenu\menu_data\ in your copy of GDMENUCardManager. Then load it up, delete entry #1 and save. This will update your card.
