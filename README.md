# OpenMenuDat
Dat files for Open Menu artwork etc

Nothing massively exciting, check gameslist.xls for all the titles covered. Artwork has a bias towards PAL, because thats my region.

Extract Box, Icon and Meta DAT files to \tools\openMenu\menu_data\ in your copy of GDMENUCardManager. Then load it up, delete entry #1 and save. This will update your card.
